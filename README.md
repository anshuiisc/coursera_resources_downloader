Installation
------------

Coursera is just a script so you can run it without installing, all that is required is that you have the required dependencies installed.
If you're not sure you can install them with: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

A setup.py is also provided, although all it does is copying coursera to your PATH so you can run it anywhere.

Usage
-----

To start using the script run it as `./coursera -h` to see the help message.
If you are in a hurry, you can just skip it and run `./coursera dl_res crypto 'your.email@example.com' 'your_password'` to start downloading videos from your course (which is crypto in the example).
